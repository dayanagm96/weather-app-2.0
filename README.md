## Weather app using Openweather API with React JS.

This app was made with the help of Axios library to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints. A weather app is one of the most common applications to build with React and since I'm still learning it, I found it practical to practice making one. Another thing to keep in mind is that the app was design mainly for mobile users, so it's going to look better on smaller screens.

To use it, you just need to add the name of the location you're interested in, and you just have to press enter. The information that the app provides is of course the temperature and how does it actually feel like, the humidity percentage, the wind and a small description (for example, if it's cloudy or clear).
